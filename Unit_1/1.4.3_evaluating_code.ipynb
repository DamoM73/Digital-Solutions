    "1. **address specific components** - these will be depending on the assessment instrument, and will be listed in the criteria sheet.\n",

    "3. **make recommendations** - the evaluation should generate recommendations on how to improve\n",

    "Desk checking is a manual (non computerised) technique for checking the logic of an algorithm. The person performing the desk check effectively acts as the computer, using pen and paper to record results. The desk checker carefully follows the algorithm being careful to rigidly adhere to the logic specified. The desk check can expose problems with the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Desk checks are useful to check an algorithm (before coding) thereby confirming that the algorithm works as expected and saves time possibly writing a program that doesn't do what was intended. Another benefit of a desk check is that it confirms to the programmer/designer that the algorithm performs as intended.\n",
    "\n",
    "A desk check is normally done as a table with columns for:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pseudo code line number - Pseudo code doesn't normally have lines numbers, but these are necessary in a desk check to specify the line(s) being executed\n",
    "- One column per variable used. \n",
    "    - The columns should be in alphabetical order on variable name with the variable name at the top of the column. \n",
    "    - As the algorithm is executed, the new values of the variables are put in the appropriate column. \n",
    "    - Show working for calculations. \n",
    "    - If variable names consist of a number of words it is permissible to put a space between each word in the name so that the name fits better in the column by wrapping to the next line. e.g. the variable column heading discount Price could be used rather than the actual variable name discountPrice.\n",
    "- condition column. \n",
    "    - The result of the condition will be true (T) or false (F). \n",
    "    - As the algorithm is executed, conditions are evaluated and the details are recorded in the column. \n",
    "    - Show working when evaluating the conditions. \n",
    "    - This is used whenever a condition is evaluated - IF WHILE or FOR statements all have explicit or implicit conditions.\n",
    "- Input/Output\n",
    "    - used to show what is input by the user and displayed by the program. \n",
    "    - Show inputs with: the variable name, a \"?\" and the value input e.g. price ? 200. \n",
