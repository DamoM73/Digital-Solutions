    "Desk checking is a manual (non computerised) technique for checking the logic of an algorithm. The person performing the desk check effectively acts as the computer, using pen and paper to record results. The desk checker carefully follows the algorithm being careful to rigidly adhere to the logic specified. The desk check can expose problems with the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Desk checks are useful to check an algorithm (before coding) thereby confirming that the algorithm works as expected and saves time possibly writing a program that doesn't do what was intended. Another benefit of a desk check is that it confirms to the programmer/designer that the algorithm performs as intended.\n",

    "A desk check is normally done as a table with columns for:\n",

    "- Pseudo code line number - Pseudo code doesn't normally have lines numbers, but these are necessary in a desk check to specify the line(s) being executed\n",
    "- One column per variable used. \n",
    "    - The columns should be in alphabetical order on variable name with the variable name at the top of the column. \n",
    "    - As the algorithm is executed, the new values of the variables are put in the appropriate column. \n",
    "    - Show working for calculations. \n",
    "    - If variable names consist of a number of words it is permissible to put a space between each word in the name so that the name fits better in the column by wrapping to the next line. e.g. the variable column heading discount Price could be used rather than the actual variable name discountPrice.\n",

    "    - closed-ended questions are quicker to respond to\n",
    "    - closed-ended questions are easier to analyse\n",
    "    - closed-ended questions guide the respondent towards the topic you want answered\n",
    "    - you can use open-ended questions, but try to limit these to around two, and place these at the end.\n",
    "- **keep your survey questions neutral**\n",
    "    - don't put an opinion in your question prompt (or asking a \"leading question\")\n",
    "    - this can influence respondents to answer in a way that doesn't reflect how they really feel\n",
    "- **have a balanced set of answer choices**\n",
    "    - make sure that your answer choices cover all the options, from the negative to the positive\n",
    "    - not balanced - Extremely helpful, Very helpful, Helpful\n",
    "    - balanced - Very helpful, Helpful, Neither helpful nor unhelpful, Unhelpful, Very unhelpful\n",
    "- **avoid \"double-barreled\" questions**\n",
    "    - double-barreled questions asks respondents to assess two different things at the same time\n",
    "    - this can cause confusion and compromise your results\n",
    "    - you need to ensure that each question addresses only one topic\n",
    "- **avoid using similarly worded questions**\n",
    "    - this can become monotonous for the respondent\n",
    "    - it can lead to respondents either leaving your survey or engaging in \"straightlining\" (answering your questions without putting much thought into them)\n",
    "    - address this by varying the types of questions you ask, how you ask them, and by spacing out questions that look similar\n",
    "- **let most of your questions be optional to answer**\n",
    "    - respondents may not know the answers to all of your questions\n",
    "    - there may be some questions they simply don't feel comfortable answering\n",
    "    - consider this when deciding which questions to require answers to. \n",
    "    - when you're unsure whether to make a certain question optional or required, lean on making it optional\n",
    "- **do a test drive**\n",
    "    - yes I want to you test the survey that you are using to test your application\n",
    "    - as a survey creator, there's no worse feeling than finding mistakes in your survey once it's already sent\n",
    "    - share your survey with colleagues, friends, and others, in advance. A pair of fresh eyes can be all it takes to spot mistakes in your survey."
