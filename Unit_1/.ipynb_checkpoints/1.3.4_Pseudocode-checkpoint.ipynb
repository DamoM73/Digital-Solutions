    "\n",
    "Pseudocode is a technique used to describe the distinct steps of an algorithm in a manner that is easy to understand for anyone with basic programming knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although pseudocode is a syntax-free description of an algorithm, it must provide a full description of the algorithm’s logic so that moving from it to implementation should be merely a task of translating each line into code using the syntax of any programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of pseudocode:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Better readability** - Often, programmers work alongside people from other domains, such as mathematicians, business partners, managers, and so on. Using pseudocode to explain the mechanics of the code will make the communication between the different backgrounds easier and more efficient.\n",
    "- **Ease up code construction** - When the programmer goes through the process of developing and generating pseudocode, the process of converting that into real code written in any programming language will become much easier and faster as well.\n",
    "- **A good middle point between flowchart and code** - Moving directly from the idea to the flowchart to the code is not always a smooth ride. That’s where pseudocode presents a way to make the transition between the different stages somewhat smoother.\n",
    "- **Act as a start point for documentation** - Documentation is an essential aspect of building a good project. Often, starting documentation is the most difficult part. However, pseudocode can represent a good starting point for what the documentation should include. Sometimes, programmers include the pseudocode as a docstring at the beginning of the code file.\n",
    "- **Easier bug detection and fixing** - Since pseudocode is written in a human-readable format, it is easier to edit and discover bugs before actually writing a single line of code. Editing pseudocode can be done more efficiently than testing, debugging, and fixing actual code."
