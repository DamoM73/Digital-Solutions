    "Python comes installed with a range of packages. This is called [The Python Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/). Although these might seem like a huge number of packages, it is actually a very small selection of packages available. These cover Python's basic operations, and limiting the install to these packages reduces the size of Python. \n",

    "At its core, the main purpose of Python virtual environments is to create an isolated environment for Python projects. This means that each project can have its own packages, regardless of what packages every other project has. The great thing about this is that there are no limits to the number of environments you can have since they're just directories containing a few scripts. "

Once your project starts involving several modules, each with hundreds of lines, it starts becoming unwieldy. This is where IDE (Integrated Development Environment) and Code Editors come in.\n",

    "An IDE (or Integrated Development Environment) is a program dedicated to software development. As the name implies, IDEs integrate several tools specifically designed for software development. These tools usually include:\n",

    "- **Save and reload code files** - allows you to save your work and reopen everything later, in the same state it was in when you left.\n",

    "- **Debugging support** - allow you to step through your code as it runs, displaying variable values etc.\n",
    "- **Syntax highlighting** - uses font colours to help you quickly spot keywords, variables, and symbols in your code. This makes reading and understanding code much easier.\n",
