    "In digital solutions, impacts are considered from social, personal and economic perspectives. Impacts are the extent to which personal, social and economic needs are met through the project. Impacts also involves consideration of the relationship between information systems and society and in particular the ethical and legal obligations of individuals and organisations regarding ownership, privacy of data and information\n",
    "\n",
    "Impacts are defined through the creation of goals and context-dependent needs at the start of the project. At the end of a project, an evaluation of the degree to which these planned impacts were implemented is conducted.\n",

    "### <font color=deepskyblue>Impact Planning</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "In planning for impacts, you need to complete a Impact Planning table, following the steps below.\n",
    "\n",
    "|  Impact goal  |  Target personas  |  Reason for Interest  |  Needs being met  |  Indicators of success  |  Usability requirements  |  Barriers  |\n",
    "|---------------|-------------------|-----------------------|-------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------|------------|\n",
    "|               |                   |                       |                   |                         |                          |            |\n",
    "|               |                   |                       |                   |                         |                          |            |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### <font color=deepskyblue>Step 1: Set your goal</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "Setting your goal is often the hardest part. This can be aided by the creation of empathy maps and user personas. These tools will give you a list of people, organisations or groups who may be interested in your project. This may lead to the identification of benefits for these groups. If identifying benefits proves difficult, it can be helpful to ask yourself why they are interested in your project and then try to convert that interest into benefits. \n",
    "\n",
    "You need to come up with a list of impacts, that is, benefits for the users of your project. Don't worry if it is a bit basic at the start - you will revisit this and improve it later. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### <font color=deepskyblue>Step 2: Target Personas and Reasons for Interest</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on your personas analysis, identify the people, groups or organisations whom this goal will impact. Then identify the reason they would be interested in this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### <font color=deepskyblue>Step 3: Needs being met</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, for each of the personas you have listed, identify what user needs are being met by the project. Also identify if different needs can be met by the same application. This will help you later on to plan the details in the develop phase of the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### <font color=deepskyblue>Step 4: Indicators of success</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "Establish how you will know if you are achieving impact. To do this identify indicators that will tell you if the user needs are being met. This will give you the indicators to look for so you know that the benefits (impacts) are being felt by the persona.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider:\n",
    "- What types of things would you expect to see in the interactions that they have with your project? \n",
    "- How will you know for certain that you have made the intended impact?\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer these questions you will need to establish a way of testing or measuring the degree to which the impact is being measured. e.g. is it faster for the user to input data into your application that it is to write it into an Excel file or into a book that records the information?\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you revisit your impact goal in the first column. Make it more specific and measureable, based on the things you have now come up with. The more specific your impact/benefit goal the more credible it will be.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### <font color=deepskyblue>Step 5: Usability requirements</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "Useability is addressed in detail in Unit 1 Topic 2. In this section you need to consider any specific usability requirements for the users.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to consider:\n",
    "- **accessibility** - ability to be used by many different people, even people with disabilities\n",
    "- **effectiveness** - ability of users to use the system to do the work they need to do, includes reliability\n",
    "- **safety** - ability for users to make errors and recover from the mistake\n",
    "- **utility** - ability of the system to provide all the functionality that users need\n",
    "- **learnability** - how easy a system is to learn\n",
    "\n",
    "#### <font color=deepskyblue>Step 6: Barriers</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider what things might prevent the project from achieving the planned benefits. Is there any way to mitigate or make sure that these things do not happen?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### <font color=deepskyblue>Step 6: Prioritise</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, stand back from your impact plan and decide which impact goals you want to pursue, and which activities you will prioritise to reach these goals for specific groups that are important to you.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might decide to focus on the goals that inspire you most, and then prioritise activities you think you can realistically do within the time and resources at your disposal. Be strategic and use your limited time wisely."
