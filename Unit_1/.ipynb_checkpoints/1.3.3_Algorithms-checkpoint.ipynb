    "There are several advantages to modularizing code in a large application:\n",
    "- **Simplicity** - Rather than focusing on the entire problem at hand, a module typically focuses on one relatively small portion of the problem. If you're working on a single module, you'll have a smaller problem domain to wrap your head around. This makes development easier and less error-prone.\n",
    "- **Maintainability** - Modules are typically designed so that they enforce logical boundaries between different problem domains. If modules are written in a way that minimizes interdependency, there is decreased likelihood that modifications to a single module will have an impact on other parts of the program. (You may even be able to make changes to a module without having any knowledge of the application outside that module.) This makes it more viable for a team of many programmers to work collaboratively on a large application.\n",
    "- **Reusability** - Functionality defined in a single module can be easily reused (through an appropriately defined interface) by other parts of the application. This eliminates the need to duplicate code.\n",
    "- **Scoping** - Modules typically define a separate namespace, which helps avoid collisions between identifiers in different areas of a program. (One of the tenets in the Zen of Python is Namespaces are one honking great idea—let’s do more of those!)\n",
