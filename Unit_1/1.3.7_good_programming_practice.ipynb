    "\n",
    "In systems engineering, dependability is a measure of a system's reliability, maintainability.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **maintainability** - easy-to-read code that is easy to dissect, so that parts relating to a required change are easy to modify without risking a chain reaction of errors in dependant modules.\n",
    "- **reliability** - the probability of a program producing an error or failing to process a task;\n",
    "    - In Digital Solutions, testing and useability considerations contribute to reliability. \n",
    "    - For example, predicting where errors are likely to occur (whether user or systems related) can inform mindful use programming constructs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### <font color=deepskyblue>Efficiency</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "A situation in which a system or machine uses minimal resources such as time and processing power while still achieving its goals; there are two types of efficiency:\n",
    "- **algorithmic efficiency** - refers to the reliability, speed and programming methodology for developing succinct structures within an application\n",
    "- **code efficiency** - is directly linked with algorithmic efficiency and the speed of runtime execution for software, and is the key element in ensuring high performance; its goal is to reduce resource consumption and completion time as much as possible with minimum risk to the business or operating environment, e.g. using a FOR loop instead of repetitive IF, THEN and ELSE statements where appropriate.\n",
