    "Direct competitors are companies that sell to the same customers and solve the same problem using the same or similar solution (technology). Solution here means using a similar technology or approach to the problem — one that seems indistinguishable to the customer. For example, Uber and Lyft are direct competitors. Similar technology would mean using the same context in Digital Solutions, that is, web application, mobile application, interaction media or intelligent systems."

    "The primary goal of a competitive analysis is to understand the marketplace and how you can differentiate you solution or product from other players. This is known as a \"point of difference\". At the end of a competitive analysis, you should create a battle card for each competitor. A competitive battle card is essentially a quick visual reference that helps you to differentiate or position your application against competitors."
