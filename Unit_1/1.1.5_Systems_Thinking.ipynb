Ecological systems and human social systems are living systems; human-made systems such as cars and washing machines are nonliving systems. (System Thinking, 2020)\n",

    "Systems thinking is a holistic approach to the identification and solving of problems, where parts and components of a system, their interactions and interrelationships are analysed individually to see how they influence the functioning of the whole system. This approach enables the understanding of systems and working with complexity, uncertainty and risk. It requires identifying and making  connections between solutions, systems and society. Systems think also requires the identification and examination of interactions between different components of a system. Essential to this is the understanding of the interdependence between information systems and how a change or output from one system can affect another, and how this affects larger systems such as the economy and society.\n",
