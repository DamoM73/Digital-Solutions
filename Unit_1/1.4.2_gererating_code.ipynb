    "\n",
    "The MVC architecture pattern turns complex application development into a much more manageable process. It is example of modularization and decomposition.\n",
    "\n",
    "MVC stands for model-view-controller. Here's what each of those components mean:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Model** - The backend that contains all the data logic\n",
    "- **View** - The frontend or user interface (UI)\n",
    "- **Controller** - The brains of the application that controls how data is displayed\n",

    "#### <font color=deepskyblue>Why use MVC?</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "We use MVC to establish **separation of concerns(SoC)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The MVC pattern helps you break up the frontend and backend code into separate components. This way, it's much easier to manage and make changes to either side without them interfering with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "But this is easier said than done, especially when several developers need to update, modify, or debug a full-blown application simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### <font color=deepskyblue>Model (data)</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "The model's job is to simply manage the data. Whether the data is from a database, API, JSON object or local file, the model is responsible for managing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### <font color=deepskyblue>Views (UI)</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "The view's job is to decide what the user will see on their screen, and how.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### <font color=deepskyblue>Controller (Brain)</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "The controller's responsibility is to pull, modify, and provide data to the user. Essentially, the controller is the link between the view and model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through **getter** and **setter** functions, the controller pulls data from the model and initializes the views.\n",
    "\n",
    "If there are any updates from the views, it modifies the data with a setter function."
