    "\n",
    "Syntax (in general) is the order or arrangement of words and phrases to form proper sentences. In the English language, the most basic syntax follows a subject + verb + direct object formula. That is, \"Jillian hit the ball.\" Syntax allows us to understand that we wouldn't write, \"Hit Jillian the ball.\" This includes the way that words are written, how phrases and sentences and even whole texts are structured. In English lessons this would be evident in the different styles of types of writing that you have done. For example narratives have a different structure or way of writing in comparison to essays and reports.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax in computer programming is the same. It is the idea of writing things out in specific ways so that computers do what we want them to do. Just like there are many different spoken languages in the world, e.g. German, English, Spanish ..., all with their own different syntaxes, so to are there many different programming languages, each of which also have their own set of syntax or 'way of writing'.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, no matter the programming language, computers are very exacting in how we structure our syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "*We're going to define syntax as essentially a set of keywords and characters that a computer can read, interpret, and convert into tasks that it knows it needs to do.*\n",
    "\n",
    "If the code you have written doesn't follow the rules of the programming language, then it will generate a syntax error. A syntax error is the computer saying \"What you say doesn't make sense\". Syntax errors are probably the most frequent error you will come across, whether it is a typo, or forgetting a special character, or missing a step. The good news is, these are the easiest errors to fix, and they are caught when the program compiles."
