    "<font color=green>*TLDR - Useability is about the how easy a product is to use, and it is influenced by it's accessability, effectiveness, safety, utility and learnability*</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "Usability is a measure of how well a specific user in a specific context can use a product/design to achieve a defined goal effectively, efficiently and satisfactorily. Designers usually measure a design's usability throughout the development process — from wireframes to the final deliverable.\n",
    "\n",
    "A design's usability depends on how well its features accommodate users' needs and contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Digital Solutions we will focus on the five usability principles of accessibility, effectiveness, safety, utility and learnability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### <font color=deepskyblue>Accessibility</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "Accessibility is the ability to be used by many different people, even people with disabilities. \n",
    "\n",
    "Accessibility guidelines are based on four principles (often referred to as POUR):\n",
    "- **Perceivable** - Information and user interface components must be presented to users in ways that they can perceive. For example, it's important to present information that can be perceived in different ways, where a user can adjust color contrast or font size, or view captions for videos.\n",
    "- **Operable**  - User interface components and navigation must be operable to users in ways they can operate. For example, required interactions can be performed using keyboard or voice commands.\n",
    "- **Understandable** - Information and user interface operation must be understandable. For example, information and instructions are clear and navigation methods are easy to understand and use.\n",
    "- **Robust** - Content must be robust enough so that it can be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of users and types of assistive technologies. As technologies evolve, code and content should remain accessible for users of common and current assistive devices and tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "### <font color=deepskyblue>Effectiveness</font>\n",
    " \n",
    "Effectiveness is the ability of users to use the system to do the work they need to do. Users need to be able to interact with a digital solution quickly and easily; and outputs need to be presented clearly in a way that can be easily interpreted by the user.Effectiveness includes reliability, which means the solution needs to be constant, dependable, consistent and repeatable. When you evaluate effectiveness you are looking for things that work or do not work as expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "### <font color=deepskyblue>Safety</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "Safety is the ability for users to make errors and recover from the mistake. \n",
    "\n",
    "Safety considers the questions:\n",
    "- How many errors do users make?\n",
    "- How severe are these errors?\n",
    "- How easily can the user recover from the errors?\n",
    "\n",
    "Safety is a little considered usability goal. Safety is protecting the users from dangerous errors, for example losing all the user's data or protecting the user's confidential information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of designing safely could include:\n",
    "- Not putting the delete button next to the save button. \n",
    "- Providing users various ways to recover from errors, both by reverting to a priority state or progressing the system to the correct state. For example in a word processor, the writer can use control-z to correct, back button, or retype to correct mistakes. \n",
    "- Making sure that input text field are wide enough to hold all the required data.\n",
    "- Limiting possible user responses with UI components like combo boxes, check boxes and radio buttons.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is always better to design interfaces that prevent errors from happening in the first place. \n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluating for safety is really about considering all the things that users could do wrong and finding ways to prevent them from making the error. This will be different for every interface or digital solution. \n",
    "\n",
    "To evaluate for safety / error prevention you essentially need to write a checklist of everything that could be done wrong and make sure that steps are taken to prevent as many of these errors as possible. The curse of knowledge dictates that you will underestimate how your solution will be misused, so it recommended to enlist the assistance of non-developers in this process.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### <font color=deepskyblue>Ways to address safety</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "Provide support information.\n",
    "- Display sufficient instructional information for uses to interact correctly with the system.\n",
    "- Design for working memory limitations. Young adults can typically remember between 3 and 5 pieces of information at a time.\n",
    "- Spell out abbreviations, initializes, and acronyms, and immediately follow them by the abbreviation, in the first instance. \n",
    "- Display sufficient content to allow users to act.\n",
    "- Use descriptive labels for objects and items.\n",
    "- Organize information clearly.\n",
    "- Ensure that necessary information is displayed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Eliminate error-prone conditions.\n",
    "- Input boxes should be wide enough for users to see and edit standard queries on the site.\n",
    "- Avoid misleading cues to click.\n",
    "- Phrasing of menu items: use familiar and consistent terminology, ensure that items are distinct from one another, use consistent and concise phrasing, and position the key words to the left of the text string.\n",
    "- Place important Items consistently.\n",
    "- Highlighting information.\n",
    "- Minimize user data entry.\n",
    "- Minimize visual clutter so that formatting and icons are effective for providing emphasis and implying priorities: draw attention to important information without introducing too much distraction.\n",
    "- Order lists appropriately.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use informative feedback.\n",
    "- Alerts need to be compatible with, and exist within, the messaging framework\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### <font color=deepskyblue>Utility</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "Utility is the ability of the system to provide all the functionality that users need. It matters little that something is easy if it's not what you want. There are many ways that a solution can be useful, and will be strongly influenced by users' needs and the desired impacts of the solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### <font color=deepskyblue>Learnability</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "Learnability is concerned with how easy a system is to learn. \n",
    "\n",
    "How intuitive or memorable is the digital solution? Does it match pre-existing patterns in other digital products? For example, does it function like a store if it is a store? Does the game use standardised controls like arrow keys of WASD?\n",

    "\n",
    "Studies conducted by the Interaction Design Foundation have shown that good aesthetics is an important feature of the user experience. Applying the elements and principles of visual communication to a user interface design improves the user experience by engaging the emotions of the user and increasing motivation to revisit the experience or complete a difficult task.\n",
    "\n",
    "### <font color=deepskyblue>Principles of Visual Communication</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "The principles of visual communication are the effects you wish to express with your design. They address the overall feel of your design and communicate a message to the user which effects the UI and UX. In other words the principles of visual communication are the **what** that you wish to achieve.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### <font color=deepskyblue>Harmony</font>\n",

    "Harmony is the pleasing effect of combining similar elements such as using similar colours, typeface and shapes throughout the design.\n",
    "\n",
    "![harmony](assets/harmony.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### <font color=deepskyblue>Balance</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "Balance occurs when the combination of elements on one side of a design appears equal to the other side. The weight of the design on each side can be influenced by use of colour, space and shape. For example, adding a dark colour to a small empty space on one side can balance a large area of black type on a white background.\n",
    "\n",
    "![balance](assets/balance.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### <font color=deepskyblue>Contrast</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "Contrast is used to emphasise an element of the design by using a markedly different colour, size or other characteristic. Contrast \n",
    "is also an important factor for readability of text. It is important that there is high contrast between the colour used for typeface and its background colour.\n",
    "\n",
    "![contrast](assets/constrast.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### <font color=deepskyblue>Proximity</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "Proximity is the positioning of elements near other elements. Proximity is an important factor in useability because it is easier to interact with a digital solution if similar functions are in close proximity to each other, such as the navigation links in a webpage.\n",
    "\n",
    "![proximity](assets/proximitya.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "![proximity](assets/proximityb.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### <font color=deepskyblue>Alignment</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "Alignment can be used to provide unity and proximity to the different elements used in the design. Good alignment aids readability and shows connections between different elements. Objects that are perfectly aligned provide a cleaner aesthetic and more professional appearance which inspires trust and confidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "![alignment](assets/alignment.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### <font color=deepskyblue>Repetition</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "Repetition of the same element throughout the design brings consistency, unity and cohesion. For example, repetition of the same icon or button shape can reduce cognitive load and improve learnability for the user. However, too much repetition can become monotonous. Small variations in line, tone or colour to a repeated element can restore interest in the design and helps to retain user attention.\n",
    "\n",
    "![repetition](assets/repetition.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### <font color=deepskyblue>Hierarchy</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "Hierarchy improves readability of the interface by emphasising more important elements with placement or size. Larger elements or those positioned towards the top of the design are considered more important.\n",

    "The elements of visual communication are the building block of UI design. You use elements of visual communication to implement the principles of visual communication to achieve your desired effect on the UI and UX. In other words, the elements of visual communication are the **how** of what you wish to achieve.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### <font color=deepskyblue>Space</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "Space is the area you have to work with. It includes space that is empty and space that contains text, images and other design features. The use of space can create clutter or simplicity.\n",

    "![space](assets/space.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### <font color=deepskyblue>Line</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "Lines can direct the user to a focal point, divide different sections, form shapes and provide emphasis. They can be think, thin, straight or wavy. They can create order or encourage creativity.\n",
    "\n",
    "![line](assets/line.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### <font color=deepskyblue>Colour</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "Colour can provide contrast or emphasis, unify a design, fill a shape or space and imply emotion. A colour scheme can be inspired by a logo or photograph. Colour theory defines rules that can be used to select aesthetically pleasing colour combinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "![colour](assets/colour.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### <font color=deepskyblue>Tone</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "Tone is the lightness or the darkness of a colour and can be contrasted to provide hierarchy, emphasis or separation of content.\n",

    "![tone](assets/tone.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### <font color=deepskyblue>Shape</font>\n",

    "\n",
    "#### <font color=deepskyblue>Texture</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "Texture can be used to add interesting to a shape or space, attract attention or unify a design by linking it to the a real world idea with a similar texture.\n",
    "\n",
    "![texture](assets/texture.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### <font color=deepskyblue>Form</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "Form is the combination of other elements to create solid effects such as the use of tone and shape to create shadows, or the use of line, shape and colour to create a 3D perspective.\n",

    "![form](assets/form.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### <font color=deepskyblue>Proportion</font>\n",
