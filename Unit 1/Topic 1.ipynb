    "### <font color=deepskyblue>Scope</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "The scope of the project provides detail about how the solution will address the problem and what types of things will be produced or delivered. The scope defines the boundaries of the system (or problem) that is being addressed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The scope includes:\n",
    "- **Problem Statement** - The problem statement is an overall descriptive statement about what needs to be solved. It includes a justification for the project (explains why is it being undertaken in the first place).\n",
    "- **Objective** - These are the overall project goals that will meet the needs of your customers. They are described in terms of the product or service that will exist at the end of the project. The developer needs to understand the objectives because it gives a basis for any decision making in the future. It also allows the developer to evaluate the most recent status of the project against the original objectives which had already been set.\n",
    "- **Deliverables** - The deliverables are the objects are that need to be produced. It may also describe the key features and what client needs are being met though them.\n",
    "- **Constraints and Limitations** - What are the barriers or things that must be adhered to. These are the requirement specifications for the project. These are summarized and typically involve a technical description. The requirements also have descriptions which are functional so that the project participants can implement them. These might include such things as the platforms the projects is being developed for and the programming languages involved.\n",
    "- **TImeline** - How long the project will run for and any specific milestones or checkpoints along the way.\n",
    "\n",
    "### <font color=deepskyblue>Constraints</font>\n",
    "A constraint is a restriction on the degree of freedom you have in providing a solution. Constraints are effectively global requirements, such as limited development resources or a decision by senior management that restricts the way you develop a system. Constraints can be economic, political, technical, or environmental and pertain to your project resources, schedule, target environment, or to the system itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of constraints:\n",
    "- The system will work on our existing technical infrastructure - no new technologies will be introduced.\n",
    "- The system will only use the data contained in the existing corporate database.\n",
    "- The system shall be available 99.99% of the time for any 24-hour period.\n",
    "\n",
    "### <font color=deepskyblue>Limitations</font>\n",
    "The limitations of the environment are concerned with what the environment can actually do, or what does the development environment allow to occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of this may be considering the IPTO.com.au development environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "This platform is run as a HTTP platform, not secured in HTTPS. This means that many modern browsers will not allow sites built on it to use certain browser APIs like the geolocation API. This may limit the ability of someone to create a map based platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "Building on a local computer and using a platform like XAMMP would allow a developer to get around this limitation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### <font color=deepskyblue>Solutions Requirements</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution requirements specify the conditions under which a system must operate (the limitations and constraints) and the capabilities that are critically required for the solution to effectively meet the needs of the users and deliver value.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution requirements require an investigation of what the users need to be able to do, but do not specify any specific way of solving the problem itself. A significant number of these requirements can be derived from the user empathy maps, personas and user journeys that have already been investigated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution requirements can generally be broken down into two different categories: functional requirements and nonfunctional requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### <font color=deepskyblue>Functional requirements</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "Functional requirements define the specific behaviors, responses, information, rules, or operations of a solution. They outline:\n",
    "- What functions or functionality the solution will support\n",
    "- What specific users will do or experience while being a part of or using the solution\n",
    "- What information or data will be managed\n",
    "- Under what circumstances the behaviors and responses happen (or not) in order to ensure the required results and outcome\n",
    "\n",
    "#### <font color=deepskyblue>Nonfunctional requirements</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "Nonfunctional requirements specify the manner or the environment in which a solution is intended to operate. They define standards for:\n",
    "- Usability: How easy the solution must be to understand or figure out\n",
    "- Reliability: To what extent users can rely on the solution to be accessible and work when needed\n",
    "- Performance: How quickly and efficiently the solution works and how it responds to commands and requests for action\n",
    "- Security: The level of protection the system and its data are expected to have in place\n",
    "- Design: The visual elements expected from the solution\n",
    "- Accessibility: The support that must be provided for users with disabilities, including hearing or vision loss, typically in compliance with relevant regulations.\n",
    "- Documentation: The type and extent of written documentation expected or needed\n",
    "- Information capacity: Requirements for the amount of data or media to be stored, including the expected growth of the information over time\n",
    "- Information architecture: Any needs for the arrangement or organization of the information in the solution\n",
    "- Anything else: Whatever else the stakeholders decide is required of the solution\n",
    "\n",
    "No matter what kind of solution requirements are identified and defined, those you elect to implement should be validated as capabilities that stakeholders really need and (as a result) decide must be included in the solution.\n",
